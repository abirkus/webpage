          WHAT WE BELIEVE

        <Typography gutterBottom component="div" align="center" paddingBottom="30px">
          It all started with a personal problem of finding a reliable mechanic and taking a car for
          service in Chicago. Carrectly became a solution: a team that solves these universal
          hassles for others. We believe in innovation, simplicity and convenience and we resolve to
          reinvent the auto service industry.

          With more available technology and less free time, people’s expectations for quality and
          simplicity are higher than ever. Yet, the auto maintenance experience continues to lag
          behind. From professional highly-trained mechanics to the best auto detailers – we can
          guarantee the best quality service there can be. We do it all: hand car washes, car
          detailing, auto upholstery, mechanical shop repairs, auto body repairs, ceramic coating,
          paint protection film, tints, and more!
        </Typography>

          Carrectly uses research, technology, and logistics to fix the lack of transparency and
          convenience of the auto maintenance business. We provide top-notch service for customers
          who value their time – one pickup, fantastic service, fair price, and drop-off at a time.
