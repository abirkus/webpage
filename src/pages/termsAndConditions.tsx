                              unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent
                              permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in
                              full force and effect.

                              otherwise, without Carrectly’s prior written consent. Any attempt by
                              you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be
                              null and of no effect. Carrectly may freely assign or transfer these
                              Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will
                              bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and
                              permitted assigns. Any notices or other communications provided by
                              Carrectly under these Terms, including those regarding modifications
                              to these Terms, will be given by Carrectly: (1) via email; or (2) by
                              posting to the Services. For notices made by e-mail, the date of
                              receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.

                              Carrectly’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms
                              will not be considered a waiver of those rights. The waiver of any
                              such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and
                              signed by a duly authorized representative of Carrectly. Except as
                              expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of
                              any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its
                              other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
