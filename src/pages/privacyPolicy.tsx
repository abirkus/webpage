                              computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access
                              the Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the
                              Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately. For
                              instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to
                              access the Services without needing to remember and then enter a
                              password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in

                              your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section
                              on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to
                              receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to
                              turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on
                              because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Service
                              features.
